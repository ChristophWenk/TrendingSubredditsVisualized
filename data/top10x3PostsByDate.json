I have no experience with blockchain, so I wanted to do a small side project before I start so I can get up to speed.  \n  \nI got into doing some trading on here about a year ago and I remember that one of the problems that everyone always talked about was the price sheet manipulation that basically everyone was using.  \n  \n  \n**Idea**  \nSo, my idea for a side project is to make a distributed blockchain based price sheet for rocket league trading.  I haven't been trading for about a year though, so I wanted to ask if this would be something that y'all would find useful? Is this still a problem that needs to be solved?\n  \nFor those of you who don't know blockchain is the technology that is behind cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.  The reason that I think that this would be a good use case for blockchain is that the prices would basically be tamperproof.  The distributed nature would mean that the prices would truly be controlled by the community, no price manipulation.  It would be a very accurate view of the perceived value of an item by the network.\n  \n  \n**Feedback**  \nFeel free to put any questions or feedback about the idea in the comments.  If there is some interest I can do some more research and preliminary work and make a follow up post with more details about what the actual implementation of this would look like.","thumbnail":"self","date":"2018-01-01","time":"03:54:41","is_self":"true","score":"42","author":"maxwmckinley","subreddit":"RocketLeagueExchange","subreddit_id":"t5_3g4tc","rn":"2"}

I was going to reply in a comment, but I feel that a lot of people can benefit from a short write-up on them.\n\n#What is a sell wall?\n\nA sell wall is a tool used by a rich individual,or group of rich individuals, to manipulate the price of a stock downwards. A large sell order is set at a specific price by the whale(s) to prevent higher sell orders from executing.\n\nA sell wall looks like this on the depth chart: http://brettwestbrook.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Screen-Shot-2017-07-12-at-12.58.10-PM.png\n\n###How does it work?\n\nThis is best explained as an example.\n\nA wealthy person, we will call him Richard, tells a group of his wealthy friends that he wants to make money on a particular stock. This could be for a number of reasons such as:\n\n* The stock has a lot of room to grow\n* The stock can be easily manipulated\n* The stock has a lot of potential to get big in the near future\n\nRichard and his friends decide that it's a good idea. They all want 1 million of X cryptocurrency. *Unfortunately, in the cryptocurrency market Richard and his friends can't execute all the buy orders at once or the prices will skyrocket!* \n\n\nTo achieve 1 million obtained goal, they decide to set up a sell wall, and manipulate the price downwards. They do this in steps:\n\n1. They accumulate together. They will maybe get 250,000 of X crypto each. In their specific market, this didn't affect the price that much. Great! \n\n2. They now set a specific price they feel is low enough for them to be able to reach their 1m X crypto goal. For this particular crypto they decide to all sell their obtained crypto at $2.40.\n\n3. Now, between Richard and the group, there is &gt;1 million dollars worth of X crypto selling for @2.40 on the market, a seemingly undervalued price.There is SO much volume being sold now, buying pressure cannot eat through that wall in a reasonable time frame - it would take a very high buying pressure to do so. \n\nWhat also happens next is the key: nobody else can sell above that sell wall price until it's gone. The result? People need to sell lower than the sell wall in order to liquefy their stock. This drives the price downwards.\n\nRichard and his friends can now safey all get to their 1m X crypto mark without raising the price exponentially! When they decide to rid their sell walls the price moves up accordingly!\n\n##How can you use this to your advantage?\n\nA common thought is that the main goal of a sell wall is to instill fear into the weaker hands so that they sell by the thought that \"Oh no everyone is selling!!\" While it's not the main purpose, it probably does happen a little bit. People get nervous when things a large volume of crypto is being sold.\n\nAs Warren Buffet said: *Be Fearful When Others Are Greedy and Greedy When Others Are Fearful.*\n\nFor a real life example:\n\nVECHAIN. \n\nFor those that don't know, about a month ago vechain was sitting around 29 cents. They had a pretty large announcement that was, yes, front page of reddit. The price nearly doubled to 70 cents (it actually happened right before the announcement). \n\nWhat happened after? Some people bought the rumor and sold the news. But, this news was really big. Masternodes, rebranding, big partnerships. Ask any VEN holder why the price didn't continue to rise after that and they will probably know why - price manipulation with sell walls.\n\nSuch as: https://i.redd.it/bjaubsgn04601.png\n\nVECHAIN has had a lot of new partnerships, announcements, and generally great news to propel the crypto further, but has been held back by these sells walls constantly. Just recently buying pressure has been very high and the whales have been having trouble controlling it they way they would like.\n\nThat's a real example of what has been happening. Take a look at roadmaps and see where different projects are at in development. Are any projects getting seemingly great news without moving in price?\n\nWhat about REQ? We saw a couple of front page posts about REQ moving to main net, quality pictures from the UI, etc etc. REQ was fairly stagnant around 30 cents before slingshotting to 80 cents in nearly a day. Sell walls and price manipulation.This field is speculative so any news drives buying pressure. Unfortunately, the very wealthy have a say as well. \n\nLook for great projects and determine if they solve a need. Look to see what's hitting the media's spot light, such as the front page here. **THEN take a look at the depth charts on the exchanges.** In crypto anything goes, and you better believe the very wealthy have difficult to obtain knowledge. When you see these obvious sell walls, you want to investigate and try to identify any trends. \n\nPerhaps you can look at **volume** of a cryptocurrency. A stagnant crypto with LOTS of volume is a huge indicator, sideways consolidation. Ripple did this for a few weeks, even months at certain stages. \n\nOnce you find one that looks good - **you'll need to hold at the mercy of the whales.** Trust me, they want profit more than you do. The wait is almost always worth it because price will rise very rapidly once selling pressure is completely abolished.\n\n\nHope this helps guys. \n\nP.s. I\u2019m not a financial consultant, this is just helpful information or fun facts if you will.","thumbnail":"self","date":"2018-01-03","time":"00:34:26","is_self":"true","score":"4858","author":"Tilted_Till_Tuesday","subreddit":"CryptoCurrency","subreddit_id":"t5_2wlj3","rn":"2"}

So I add more crates to my original offer. Gets downvoted to hell. This is where it pisses me off. So I say \"Alright \n, strange but whatever, I'll make ANOTHER offer.\" So I offer: 20xx, Cobalt venom, FG FGSP, and a crimson cromulon for a bubbly. That gets downvoted more than my last post. Currently at 13% Is that not better than my original offer that got 4 Upvotes!? I honestly have no idea with the fucking community anymore. Like I've asked for price checks on my Fireplug set and have gotten downvoted to 30 something %. Like, people, cool it with the downvote button.\n\nThis is not me complaining about not getting Bubbly, it's annoying that people sit on their high horse and downvote everything. If you were trading something for an item you want and you see a post that has 2 Upvotes, and the other post has 1 downvote, what will you take? The 2 Upvotes obviously. It helps people see if it's a good offer or not. Just calm down with the button people. \n\n\nI'm expecting downvotes just because I'm not making a post about a TW wheel or a TW Octane.

I don't get the whole \"keycism\", but I will ignore that for the sake of this argument. Many people post their trades like this :\n\n&gt;B/O: 250 Keys.\n\nThis indicates that you are accepting ANY csgo keys, unless you state otherwise.\n\nThis can happen in the form of the B/O itself(i.e. : \"B/O: 250 keys, no vanilla or esports keys\") or in a note after your B/O(i.e : \"B/O: 250 Keys.\n\nI am not accepting vanilla or esports keys.\")\n\nIf you just post a B/O without mentioning that you don't want certain keys and then **decline or counteroffer the B/O with other keys**, you will get a declined B/O ban. This is both a waste of our time and a waste of your time.\n\nSo I would like to encourage all of you to think of this before you post your next B/O.\n\nThis might seem like a pretty useless post to some people, because this should be common sense.

From doing his research before hand, this limit was it mentioned nowhere.  After contacting support they provided no help and pushed him away telling him there is nothing they can do.  Since he has to wait, he lost more than $200 already due to the token dropping, even though they claim that the token is the fastest and cheapest way to purchase skins.  How can it be the cheapest way if you can't deposit all your tokens instantly and WAX is so volatile?  As the guy says, it seems like they might have this restriction so they have more money invested in the currency.  ~~However, thats just speculation so take it with a grain of salt.~~ [he was right](https://www.reddit.com/r/opskins/comments/7povae/discussion_a_big_secret_opskins_omits_from_using/dsj1txq/)  Regardless, OP was less than helpful and refused to provide any sort of solution and was vague in every response they gave him. \n Overall these actions by OP would quite sad to see from such a company, until you realize this isn't even close to the first time they've done things like this..

[This is by design](https://opskins.com/kb/api-v2). As such, you should treat it the same as you would a password.\n\n[I'm talking about this button right here](http://files.steamrep.com/010/img/opskins-request-api-key.png), in your Opskins account settings. Don't use it.\n\nIf you listed any items in Opskins, then whoever has your API key can trivially claim any and all of those items, because the API key gives them full access to your Opskins account, including the ability to accept offers and change prices. Even though an API key generated from Opskins won't give them your *Steam* account, a scammer can still take any items you have stored on Opskins, because those storage accounts are controlled by Opskins, not you.\n\nThe way this scam works is typically a scammer will first ask you for an Opskins API key. If you have anything already listed there (which he might've asked you to list first), then he will quickly change its price to something like $0.02 and buy it. If there's nothing listed, he may ask you to list items, stating he only buys through Opskins, and will refuse to trade directly in Steam; possibly telling you this from a different account. You'll see the items inexplicably sold for a ridiculous price, as the scammer removes you.\n\n**If you don't know what an API key is, then don't generate one.** [API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface \"Application Programming Interface\") keys are used for programming purposes, such as making your own trading bots, and there's absolutely no reason for 99% of traders to use this kind of feature. Scammers are capitalizing on the fact that most Steam users aren't programmers and don't know what this means.\n\nAs a more general rule of thumb, with any features, if you don't understand what something is, don't use it. *Especially* if the other trader is offering a really good deal for using it instead of trading normally. Whenever someone comes to you with a weird request like this, you should simply insist on trading within the Steam trade window only, or else you may end up learning about the next big new scam the hard way.\n\nApologies to those of you already aware of the scam. This is a scam I've seen reported a lot lately, and it seems to be on the rise, so it's better to try and inform some of you here who haven't seen it yet.","thumbnail":"self","date":"2018-01-14","time":"21:57:00","is_self":"true","score":"119","author":"Twilight_Sniper","subreddit":"GlobalOffensiveTrade","subreddit_id":"t5_2y6r4","rn":"1"}

We've seen a peak bubble at around 850 billion total market cap in the first week of January, consolidated down to $750 billion and have now just experienced a 40% correction. \n\n#What's happening now and how bad will it get?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFirst of all you should realize that there is a [January Dip that happens every year, when we see a roughly 20-30% decline around mid January](https://i.imgur.com/VXEHw0W.png). This year its been much more severe though for several additional factors that have compounded on top.\n\nDifferent theories exist on why this happens (its actually the mirror opposite of the \"January Effect\" that happens in the US stock market), but the two major theories are:\n\n1) Asian markets pull into fiat because of Asian New Year spending needs\n\n2) People in the US sell in January to defer their capital gains tax liability an extra year\n\nWhile this cyclic event has lead to a healthy correction in the last few years, this year we got these new factors making more fear as well:\n\n* [Yet more scary news on China cracking down on crypto exchanges](http://www.coindesk.com/pboc-official-calls-for-wider-ban-on-chinese-crypto-trading-report/)\n\n* [Korea regulatory uncertainty](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-16/cryptocurrencies-resume-slide-as-bitcoin-tumbles-to-december-low)\n\n* [European governments talking about regulations](http://news.yahoo.com/rule-bitcoin-must-global-germanys-central-bank-says-154144224--business.html)\n\n* [BTC futures contracts are now expiring this week](http://www.cmegroup.com/trading/equity-index/us-index/bitcoin_quotes_settlements_futures.html), and possible manipulation there with contract hedging pushing the price down\n\n* Bitconnect Ponzi finally collapses\n\n* We had a new breed of speculators come in during the November/December timeframe after media made cryptocurrency mainstream following the Bitcoin 10K landmark. While cryptocurrency markets have always had too much hype, the latest rise wasn't just over-enthusiasm in fundamentally sound cryptocurrencies like Monero and Ethereum, but mass inflows of fiat into vaporware and complete nonsense without any use case. Many people came in to essentially gamble on symbols on an exchange, and are thus short term oriented and quick to sell on any slight downturn, which such further adds to selling pressure.\n\nSo in essence we got a storm of scary news along with the usual cyclic downturn. Currently I don't see this as being a systematic crash like Mt.Gox was that would lead to a long term bear market because the fundamental ecosystem is still intact, and I suspect that after about a month we should consolidate around a new low. All the exchanges are still operational and liquid, and there is no breakdown in trust nor uncertainty whether you'll be able to cash out. What range the market trades in will all depend how Bitcoin does, right now we've already broken below 10K but I'm seeing a lot of support at around $8000, which is [roughly where the long term MA curve settles](https://i.imgur.com/kKVsoUt.png). I don't expect us going below that support line anytime soon without any systematic breakdown. The fact we got closer to it is actually quite healthy in the long term because [it is a valuation that can be logically justified using the cost factors of the mining network.](http://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7n47be/i_built_these_3_fundamental_valuation_models_for/) In addition when I run a regression on the price history before the crazy Nov/December bull run, [the first Fibonacci level seems to be just around $8000](https://i.imgur.com/L6aDQRG.png). So I think we should consistantly move above that support level, possibly with a few weeks of fluctuations between the $9-$13K range. \n\n**What should you do if you recently entered the market?**\n\nIf you did buy in the last few months at or near ATH, the very worst thing you can do now is sell in panic and lose your principal. You shouldn't have more money in crypto than you can afford to lose, so it shouldn't be a problem to wait a few months. You have to realize that 30% corrections in crypto are relatively common, just last fall we had a 40% flash correction over more China fears. Unless there is a systematic breakdown like we had during Mt.Gox, the market always recovers. \n\nThe other worst thing you can do is unload into Tether as your safety net. If there is one thing that could actually cause a long term destruction of trust within the cryptocurrency investment ecosystem, its Tether having a run up on their liabilities and not having enough reserve to cover the leverage. It would not only bring down exchanges but lead to years of litigation and endless media headlines that will scare off everybody from putting fiat in. I don't know when the next Mt.Gox meltdown will occur but I can almost guarantee it will involve Tether. So stay away from it.\n\n**What should long term investors do?**\n\nFor long term holders a good strategy to follow each year is to capture profit each December and swallow the capital gains taxation liability, park a reserve of fiat at Gemini (whose US dollar deposits are FDIC-insured) and simply wait till around late January to early February to re-enter the market at a discount and hold all year until next December. You can keep a small amount in core coins in order to trade around various Q1 opportunities you anticipate. Others may choose to simply do nothing and just keep holding throughout January which is also a perfectly fine strategy. The cyclical correction usually stabilizes toward late January and early February, then we see a rise in March and generally are recovered by end of April. Obviously this decision whether to sell in December to profit on the dip and pay tax liability or to just hold will depend on your individual tax situation. Do your own math sometime in November and follow suit.\n\n#How to construct your portfolio going forward\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRather than seeing the correction as a disaster see it as a time to start fresh. If you have been FOMO-ing into bad cryptos and losing money now is a time to start a systematic long term approach to investing rather than gambling.\n \n\n**Follow a methodology for evaluating each cryptocurrency**\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMemes and lambo dreams are fun and all, but I know many of you are investing thousands of dollars into crypto, so its worth it to put some organized thought into it as well. I can't stress enough how important it is to try and logically contruct your investment decisions. If you follow a set methodology, a checklist and template you will be able to do relative comparisons between cryptocurrencies, to force yourself to consider the negatives and alternative scenarios and also sleep comfortably knowing you have a sound basis for your investment decisions (even if they turn out to be wrong). \n\nThere is no ideal or \"correct\" methodology but I can outline mine:\n\n**1) Initial information gathering and filtering**\n\nOnce I identify something that looks like a good potential investment, I first go to the CoinMarketCap page for that symbol and look at the website and blockchain explorer. \n\n* Critically evaluate the website. This is the first pass of the bullshit detector and you can tell from a lot from just the website whether its a scam. If it uses terms like \"Web 4.0\" or other nonsensical buzzwords, if its unprofessional and has anonymous teams, stay away. Always look for a roadmap, compare to what was actually delivered so far. Always check the team, try to find them on LinkedIn and what they did in the past. \n\n* Read the whitepaper or business development plan. You should fully understand how this crypto functions and how its trying to create value. If there is no use case or if the use case does not require or benefit from a blockchain, move on. Look for red flags like massive portions of the float being assigned to the founders of the coin, vague definition of who would use the coin, anonymous teams, promises of large payouts...etc\n\n* Check the blockchain explorer. How is the token distribution across accounts? Are the big accounts holding or selling? Which account is likely the foundation account, which is the founders account? \n\n* Read the subreddit and blogs for the cryptocurrency and also evaluate the community. Try to figure out exactly what the potential use cases are and look for sceptical takes. Look at the Github repos, does it look empty or is there plenty of activity?\n\n\n**2) Fill out an Investment Checklist**\n\nI have a checklist of questions that I find important and as I'm researching a crypto I save little snippets in Evernote of things that are relevant to answering those questions:\n\n* What is the problem or transactional inefficiency the coin is trying to solve?\n\n* What is the Dev Team like? What is their track record? How are they funded, organized?\n\n* Who is their competition and how big is the market they're targeting? What is the roadmap they created?\n\n* What current product exists?\n\n* How does the token/coin actually derive value for the holder? Is there a staking mechanism or is it transactional?\n\n* What are the weaknesses or problems with this crypto?\n\n\n\n**3) Create some sort of consistent valuation model/framework, even if its simple** \n\nI have a background in finance so I like to do Excel modeling. For those who are interested in that, this [article is a great start](https://hackernoon.com/the-7-things-you-need-to-know-from-the-valuing-cryptocurrency-conference-call-c238095a03b9) and also Chris Burniske has a great blog about using Quantity Theory of Money to build an equivalent of a DCF analysis for crypto.\n\n[Here is an Excel file example of OMG done using his model](http://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FvYGe0TA-rZR00iAV2PDI-B9zba6GpEG1FodECWJDys/edit).  You can download this and play around with it yourself, see how the formulas link and understand the logic.\n\nOnce you have a model set up the way you like in Excel you can simply alter it to account for various float oustanding schedule and market items that are unique to your crypto, and then just start plugging in different assumptions. Think about what is the true derivation of value for the coin, is it a \"dividend\" coin that you stake within a digital economy and collect fees or is it a currency? Use a realistic monetary velocity (around 5-10 for currency and around 1-2 for staking) and for the discount rate use at least 3x the long term return of a diversified equity fund.\n\nThe benefit is that this forces you to think about what actually makes this coin valuable to an actual user within the digital economy its participating in and force you to think about the assumptions you are making about the future.  Do your assumptions make sense? What would the assumptions have to be to justify its current price? You can create different scenarios in a matrix (optimistic vs. pessimistic) based on different assumptions for risk (discount rate) and implementation (adoption rates).\n\nIf you don't understand the above thats perfectly fine, you don't need to get into full modeling or have a financial background. Even a simple model that just tries to derive a valuation through relative terms will put you above most crypto investors. Some simple valuation methods that anyone can do\n\n* [Metcalfe's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metcalfe's_law) which states that the value of a network is proportional to the square of the number of connected users of the system (n^2). So you can compare various currencies based on their market cap and square of active users or traffic. \n\n* Another easy one is simply looking at the total market for the industry that the coin is supposedly targeting and comparing it to the market cap of the coin. Think of the market cap not only with circulating supply like its shown on CMC but including total supply. For example the total supply for Dentacoin is 1,841,395,638,392, and when multiplied by its price in early January we get a market cap that is actually higher than the entire industry it aims to disrupt: Dentistry. \n\n* If its meant to be just used as just a currency: Take a look at the circulating supply and look at the amount that is in cold storage or set to be released/burned. Most cryptos are deflationary so think about how the float schedule will change over time and how this will affect price. \n\nOnce you have a model you like set up, you can compare cryptos against each other and most importantly it will require that you build a mental framework within your own mind on why somebody would want to own this coin other than to sell it to another greater fool for a higher price. Modeling out a valuation will lead  you to think long term and think about the inherent value, rather than price action.\n\nOnce you go through this 3-step methodology, you'll have a pretty good confidence level for making your decision and can comfortably sit back and not panic if some temporary short term condition leads to a price decrease. This is how \"smart money\" does it.\n\n**Think about your portfolio allocation**\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nYou should think first in broad terms how you allocate between \"safe\" and \"speculative\" cryptos. \n\nFor new investors its best to keep a substantial portion in what would be considered largecap safe cryptos, primarily BTC, ETH, LTC. I personally consider XMR to be safe as well. A good starting point is to have between 50-70% of your portfolio in these safe cryptocurrencies. As you become more confident and informed you can move your allocation into speculative small caps.\n\nYou should also think in terms of segments and how much of your total portfolio is in each segment:\n\n* Core holdings - BTC, Ethereum, LTC...etc\n\n* Platform segment - Ethereum, NEO, Ark...etc\n\n* Privacy segment - Monero, Zcash, PivX..etc\n\n* Finance/Bank settlement segment - Ripple, Stellar...etc\n\n* Enterprise Blockchain solutions segment -VeChain, Walton, WABI...etc\n\n* Promising/Innovative Tech segment - Raiblocks, IOTA, Cardano...etc\n\nYou should also think about where we are in the cycle, as now given so much uncertaintly its probably best to stay heavily in core holdings and pick up a few coins within a segment you understand well. If you don't understand how enterprise solutions work or how the value chain is built through corporations, don't invest in the enteprise blockchain solutions segment. If you are a technie who loves the technology behind Cardano or IOTA, invest in that segment.\n\n**Think of your \"circle of competence\"**\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis is actually a term Buffet came up with, it refers to your body of knowledge that allows you to evaluate an investment. Think about what you know best and consider investing in those type of coins. If you don't know anything about how supply chains functions, how can you competently judge whether VeChain or WaltonChain will achieve adoption? \n\nThis where your portfolio allocation also comes into play. You should diversify but really shouldn't be in much more than around 12 cryptos, because you simply don't have enough competency to accurately access the risk across every segment and for every type of crypto you come across. If you had over 20 different cryptos in your portfolio you should probably think about consolidating to a few sectors you understand well. \n\n\n\n**Continually educate yourself about the technology and markets**\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you aren't already doing it: Read a bit each day about cryptocurrencies. There are decent Youtubers that talk about the market side of crypto, just avoid those that hype specific coins and look for more sceptical ones like CryptoInvestor. If you don't understand how the technology works and what the benefits of a blockchain are or how POS/POW works or what a DAG is or how mining actually works, learn first. If you don't care about the technology or find reading about it tedious, you shouldn't invest in this space at all.\n\n\n\n\n**Technical analysis isn't that useful over the short term in crypto, so stop daytrading**\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTechnical analysis was initially developed by financial professionals primarily to measure momentum based on historical data. It can be useful in regulated efficient stock markets for a very good reason: patterns are fairly predictable in stocks since they are a result of intrinsic events (such as quarterly earning reports) or extrinsic events (interest rate change announced). Its true that we also have movement that is based around insider information, however we have laws that keep that to a minimum. Add to this the fact that most stocks are held with large institutional investors and bought and sold by financial professionals who slowly add and decrease their position over long term plans, which is why its rare for the wild swings within short periods. These different intrinsic and extrinsic events all have a correlation in price, and because the markets are regulated and efficient we can use them to predict movement within a reasonable degree of confidence. \n\nNone of this is true for crypto. Its completely unregulated and insider trading and PnD schemes are rampant. No technical analysis in the world takes into account that all it takes for a crypto to double is John McAffee to post a single sentence about it on Twitter, or a sub of a smaller crypto to organize a shilling operation on /r/CryptoCurrency. Its also filled with weak hands who will dump on any sign of sellling pressure.\n\nThis is why trying to use technical analysis tools from the stock market for short term trading in crypto isn't that useful. Technical analysis was meant to predict pricing movement in a regulated and efficient environment. \n\nSo stop daytrading. If you use technical analysis, use it for long term trend confirmation. Any attempt to trade short term based on price momentum is pure gambling. If you want to gamble get a girl and some friends and go to a casino and drink while you do it, its much more fun.\n\n\n\n#Summing it up\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI predicted a few days ago that we would have a major correction in 2018 specifically in the altcoins that saw massive gains in Decemeber/early January, and it seems we've already had a pretty big one. I don't think we'll have a complete meltdown like some are predicting, but some more pain may be incoming.\n\nBasically take this time to think about how you can improve your investment style and strategy. Make a commitment to value things rather than chasing FOMO, and take your time to make a decision. Long term investment will grant you much more returns as will a systematic approach.\n\nTake care and have fun investing :)","thumbnail":"self","date":"2018-01-17","time":"22:24:59","is_self":"true","score":"14481","author":"arsonbunny","subreddit":"CryptoCurrency","subreddit_id":"t5_2wlj3","rn":"3"}

The ponzi and pyramid schemes currently around (that I'm aware of) are:\n\n1. BCC Cash (note that this is different from Bitcoin Cash)\n* BCHconnect\n* Billion Bit Club\n* Binary Coin\n* Bit Sequence\n* BitAI\n* Bitchamps\n* Bitclub/clubcoin\n* Bitcoin Ascension (pyramid scheme)\n* Bitconnect X\n* Bitether\n* Bitfinite\n* Bitfintech\n* Bitglare Coin\n* Btchash\n* Btc-Rush\n* Btcwait\n* Chrysos\n* Coinrium\n* Cointeum\n* Coinspace\n* Dascoin\n* Ecomcash\n* Eigencoin\n* ETHconnect\n* Etherbanking\n* Exacoin\n* Falcon Coin\n* Farstcoin\n* Ficoin\n* Firstcoin\n* Forzacoin\n* Futurecoin\n* FUU Coin\n* Gold Reward Token\n* Goldgate\n* Hedgeconnect\n* Hextracoin\n* Home Block Coin\n* HotCrypto\n* Hydrocoin\n* Ibiscoin\n* iCenter\n* Ideacoin\n* iFan\n* Iotaconnect\n* Knox Coin\n* Legendcoin\n* Lendconnect\n* Lendera\n* Libra Coin\n* Liteconnect\n* Loancoin\n* Martcoin\n* Moneroconnect\n* Monetize Coin\n* Monyx\n* Neoconnect\n* Numiv\n* Oalend Coin\n* Onecoin\n* Pagarex\n* Purpose/DUBI\n* Regalcoin\n* Rothscoin\n* Secular Coin\n* SFICoin\n* Steneum\n* Stepium (pyramid scheme)\n* Swisscoin (pyramid scheme)\n* Tenocoin\n* TEX Coin\n* Thorn Coin\n* Ucoin Cash\n* Unix Coin\n* USI Tech\n* WCI\n* Western Coin\n* XRPconnect\n\nDefunct ponzi schemes:\n\n1.

There are many other scams out there, but I haven't included them here because many of them are controversial, so deciding with great certainty if some are scams would be much more difficult, and because making this post is already a lot of work. \n\n**I had a list of people here who were promoting some of the above scams on Youtube, but I've decided to remove it at least temporarily as some users suggested. For now, I'll work on adding to the above lists, then in the next few days I'll probably (at least partially) restore what I've removed along with additions that people posted in this thread. If you really want to see the list of youtubers I had here, send me a PM.** And for those who have sent me a PM that I haven't responded to yet, be patient, I'm taking a break now and I still have messages that I haven't had time to read yet.\n\nI'd also like to make a special shout out to coinmarketcap.com for advertising Bitconnect and possibly other coins listed above, and I'd like to thank the following Redditors for contributing to these lists:\n\n/u/808hunna, /u/AceDoja, /u/AllForTheGains, /u/Antranik, /u/arse_nal666, /u/BamboozleVictim, /u/Batman_MD, /u/bluebachcrypto, /u/Calmersky, /u/DemarcoFC, /u/DestroyerOfShitcoins, /u/dvxvdsbsf, /u/EClarkee, /u/Furples, /u/gtfobitches, /u/GuessParryGod, /u/Huuuui, /u/iambinksy, /u/infinityplus0ne, /u/jckwho, /u/Kl4n, /u/KnifeOfPi2, /u/lailide, /u/laminatorius, /u/LordGriffiths, /u/Miqote_Menstruation, /u/mscohe01, /u/normal_rc, /u/nudeinmylivingroom, /u/omegaape, /u/presstab, /u/ptikok, /u/RatToken, /u/Randall_Maller, /u/ripbum, /u/ScroogeMcDuckyPants, /u/Seriously2much, /u/shilch, /u/Sitchu, /u/skotua, /u/slinky_wizard, /u/sToRmRaDe, /u/TheMinero, /u/TheSuspiria, /u/theyork2000, /u/Timbuk220, /u/Too_Trill_To_Fail, /u/tuankiet65, /u/white_knight3, /u/zamli\n\nMore contributions are also welcome!

We've actually known each other for 20+ years and they both live a couple of blocks away.

The person will post a trade offering a white octane RLCS decal and ~10 crates for a black market worth significantly less, such as parallax. The person will put the crates in the trade window first, then add the white RLCS. However, once there are enough items in the window there is no way to tell what car the decal is for. The scammer will put a white RLCS for a different car into the window, and act as if it is for the octane. If you accept, you will lose around 8-10 keys. \n\nI've never seen this before, so I thought I would mention it here to possibly save a few people some keys and time.

The higher the level of your plunderblade, the more items your palico can steal. The most I got was an extra five items which included a Odagoron Gem!\n\nAt higher levels, apart from stealing an item, when struck with the plunderblade, the monster will also drop extra parts on the ground which can be picked up by your Hunter.\n\n\n\nHERE'S HOW TO GET IT :\n\n\nITEMS YOU NEED : 1 piece of raw meat.\n\nMake sure you have the lower depths of the Rotten Vale unlocked (unlocked via story quests) so that you have access to areas 13 &amp; 15. \n\nWith the raw meat in your inventory, head over to area 13 and speak to the lynian researcher. He'll tell you how he can't spot the grimalkynes which go by the name of \"The Plunderers\"  inhabiting this area. \n\nOnce you've talked to him, wait a few minutes - go farm some resources and then head back to area 13. You'll see that there's a grimalkyne there. It'll spot you and run away. Follow it (your scout flies will guide you to it so don't worry if you lose him.) and it'll lead you to area 15. \n\nOnce there, you'll see that he will run off into an area that you cannot access. Your palico will then say that the grimalkyne looks like he's hungry. \n\nNow, place the raw meat that you brought on the ground SOMEWHERE THE GRIMALKYNE CAN SEE and HIDE\n(go into sneak mode and stay out of sight from the grimalkyne)\n\nCautiously, the grimalkyne will slowly make its way down and call his other buddies to start eating the food. This is when you'll want to approach them and the will start a conversation. At the end, they'll reward you the Plunderblade!\n\nIF THE GRIMALKYNE DOES NOT APPEAR AT AREA 13 : \n\n\u2022 Try completing all the research delivery quests (The fishing and creature capture ones) for the previous maps and for the Rotten Vale.\n\n\u2022 Try joining all the Grimalkynes in the previous maps and then try the Rotten Vale again \n(This is the method that worked for me) \n\nHappy hunting!\n","thumbnail":"self","date":"2018-01-29","time":"00:12:53","is_self":"true","score":"4131","author":"fuzzehbearr","subreddit":"MonsterHunter","subreddit_id":"t5_2rron","rn":"2"}

Remember those useless certified toppers that you could trade up 5 of to get that oh-so-coveted breakout junk food decal that everyone and their grandma is trying to hack into your PS4 to get?

When you panic sell at times like this you are offloading your crypto to people who are very aware that the market will swing back up. Institutional money was never going to jump into crypto at the ATH and make all is little guys rich in the process, that not what they do. They manipulate markets, using the media, and they shake out the weak hands so they can scoop up everything they want for fractions of the price. The shit thing is it's working. Those guys you saw buying lambos and bullshit at the end of last year are the ones who didn't panic sell after the Mt Gox crash thinking \"Atleast I'll come out of this with something\". Look at the volumes at the moment, look at the amount of coins being accumulated right now, who do you think are the ones doing that? You think a bunch of investors with deep pockets just stumbled ass-backwards into the market and don't bother reading the news? Think. If you're selling right now you are selling to rich guys that know something you don't. \n\nPut the phone down, go an do whatever it was you were doing before crypto for the next month, for the next three months even. Or don't, panic sell to guys that know exactly what they are doing and lament it at the end of the year. We all saw the comments and posts of people warning that after the bull market will come days when everything drops 20% round the board. Well those days are here. No one ever got rich panic selling.  \n\nI'm not frustrated cause my portfolio is dropping, it'll be back. I'm frustrated because all of us little guys have the possibility to ride this wave up because we got here early, and we're dropping like flies at the moment. It's going to be heartbeaking reading this sub in a year's time seeing everyone who sold now thinking it was the end. Look at the tech, look at the partnerships both corporate and government. This isn't pokemon go, it's not a fad that only lasts a few months. Crypto isn't going anywhere, please don't waste this opportunity.

{"title":"The Beginning of the End of the Mueller Investigation","id":"7utdko","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/7utdko/the_beginning_of_the_end_of_the_mueller/","permalink":"/r/The_Donald/comments/7utdko/the_beginning_of_the_end_of_the_mueller/","selftext":"#Hello, and welcome to the beginning of the end of the Mueller Investigation.\n\nToday we're going to discuss the legal doctrine of the \"Fruit of the Poisonous Tree.\" \n\nI want to take you back in time to 1920, where Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. delivered an opinion of the Supreme Court where this famous legal doctrine makes its first appearance in Supreme Court Jurisprudence. While the doctrine is not fully realized until almost 20 years later, we see the Supreme Court first contemplate the issue.\n\nNow, [Silverthorne Lumber Co. v. United States, 251 U.S. 385 (1920)](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/251/385/case.html) was a case where federal agents illegally seized tax records, made copies, and tried to present them as evidence in the prosecution of Silverthorne Lumber Company. Now, long story short, the Supreme Court was not having any of that. A rather famous quote delivered by Oliver, known for his short but scathing opinions, reads: \n\n&gt;In our opinion, such is not the law. It reduces the Fourth Amendment to a form of words. The essence of a provision forbidding the acquisition of evidence in a certain way is that not merely evidence so acquired shall not be used before the Court, but that it shall not be used at all.\n\nHolmes further states:\n\n&gt;Of course, this does not mean that the facts thus obtained become sacred and inaccessible. If knowledge of them is gained from an **independent** source they may be proved like any others, but the **knowledge gained by the Government's own wrong cannot be used by it in the way proposed.**\n\nHmmm. Well what do we now have confirmation of that we have known for weeks if not months?\n\n* The political origins of the Steele dossier were known to senior DOJ and FBI officials, but excluded from the FISA applications.\n\n*  Andrew McCabe confirmed that no FISA warrant would have been sought from the FISA Court without the Steele dossier information.\n\nAny almonds activating yet? No? Well, let me continue.\n\nIn 1939, Justice Frankfurter delivered the opinion of the Supreme court in the case [Nardone v. United States, \n308 U.S. 338 (1939)](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/308/338/case.html) which finally gave the legal doctrine we know today its name. Below is a quick excerpt that may pique your interest in how this applies to the Trump sham investigation into \"collusion\" with the Russians:\n\n&gt;The burden is, of course, on the accused in the first instance to prove to the trial court's satisfaction that wiretapping was unlawfully employed. Once that is established -- as was plainly done here -- the trial judge must give opportunity, however closely confined, to the accused to prove that a substantial portion of the case against him was a fruit of the poisonous tree. This leaves ample opportunity to the Government to convince the trial court that its proof had an independent origin.\n\nGetting there yet? What else do we now have confirmation of? \n\n* The Steele dossier formed an essential part of the intial and all three renewal FISA applications against Carter Page.\n\nWait, wait, wait. So the basis of the FISA applications that were carried out during the end of the Obama administration were based on this? \n\nOn January 11, 2017, The Guardian reported that the FBI initially applied for a FISA warrant in June 2016, requesting to \"monitor four members of the Trump team suspected of irregular contacts with Russian officials.\" **This initial request was denied.** \n\nA source told The Guardian that the FBI then submitted a more narrowly focused request in October, \"but that has not been confirmed, and it is not clear whether any warrant led to a full investigation.\" \n\nSo, now we know \"more narrowly focused\" just means that the Dossier was used as the basis for the approved FISA applications. The same dossier that was misrepresented to the FISA Court Judge, despite the FBI and DOJ knowing the political basis of the dossier itself. \n\nBut, but, muhhh people involved said everything was done appropriately and there was no foul play going on. \n\nWhat happened to Comey? What recently happened to McCabe? What is about to happen to the **COUNTLESS** other FBI and DOJ officials involved in this debacle that will be revealed soon by the Inspector General, Horowitz?\n\nI'll give you a hint. Heads will roll. Didn't you find it strange that [Mueller decided to postpone Mike Flynn's sentencing?](https://www.cnn.com/2018/01/31/politics/robert-mueller-michael-flynn/index.html)\n\nI certainly did, and now I think it is more clear why. \n\nMueller knows he's fucked. His whole special counsel investigation was based on these \"illegal\" FISA warrants, that were illegally presented to the FISA court despite the FBI's and DOJ's knowledge of its origin. McCabe was asked explicitly by Congress if he knew this and he testified that he didn't remember. Also of note, the insurance policy that was mentioned in a metting held in his office involving the disgraced FBI agent **THAT SERVED ON MUELLER'S SPECIAL COUNSEL** Peter Strozk. \n\nAlso of note:\n\n* Six of the 15 lawyers have not made campaign contributions to any political campaigns at the federal level.\n\n* Among the lawyers who did make contributions, a total of $62,043 went to Democrats and $2,750 to Republicans, according to the special counsel\u2019s office.\n\n* In terms of Clinton specifically, election filings indicate that three lawyers gave her 2016 presidential campaign a total of $700; and three gave a total of $18,100 to either her 2016 campaign or her 2008 run for the presidential nomination.\n\nThis is the beginning of the end of the Mueller Investigation. Take it to the bank, as Nancy Pelosi would say.\n\nAny evidence of wrongdoing, these sham indictments with no relation to \"Russian Collusion\" will all go away. The Supreme Court still stands by their support of Constitutional Fourth Amendment rights. This will not go over well. There is already extreme disfavor for special counsels in general, due to their wide ranging latitude in effectively serving as an unchecked fourth branch of government that circumvents the judiciary. Severe doubts have been raised in past Supreme Court Jurisprudence about the validity of the constitutionality of such counsels. This certainly will be a blow in future cases with how the Supreme Court looks to be composed at this moment, and into the future.\n\nThis level of bias, mixed with a seemingly unlimited power of the special counsel, has been a problem for decades. This issue is now the hot talking point of the year. We know Trump has known all of this information since at least [March 4^th, 2017](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/837989835818287106). He knew, and waited this long for vindication.\n\n Well guess what REEEEEEEEEEEEsisters? Vindication is here. Your day of reckoning is upon you. Mueller will not be able to effectively stage a coup on our legitimately elected president. The democrats are the only party that we have proof of that colluded with foreign agents to try and influence the election. \n\nThis [suprisingly based article](http://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/351495-it-looks-like-obama-did-spy-on-trump-just-as-he-did-to-me) from September of 2017 sheds some more insight onto the scope of these abuses:\n\n&gt;Officials involved in the surveillance and unmasking of U.S. citizens have said their actions were legal and not politically motivated. And there are certainly legitimate areas of inquiry to be made by law enforcement and intelligence agencies. But look at the patterns. It seems that government monitoring of journalists, members of Congress and political enemies \u2014 under multiple administrations \u2014 has become more common than anyone would have imagined two decades ago. So has the unmasking of sensitive and highly protected names by political officials.\n\nThe corruption has been identified. The corruption will be weeded out. Look for the Inspector General to be dropping names of more agents within the FBI and DOJ officials involved in this scandal. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n","thumbnail":"self","date":"2018-02-02","time":"18:30:02","is_self":"true","score":"10373","author":"BamaBangs","subreddit":"The_Donald","subreddit_id":"t5_38unr","rn":"3"}

{"title":"A guide on how not to get scammed","id":"7uvvxz","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLeagueExchange/comments/7uvvxz/a_guide_on_how_not_to_get_scammed/","permalink":"/r/RocketLeagueExchange/comments/7uvvxz/a_guide_on_how_not_to_get_scammed/","selftext":"#First things first: Search [THE SCAMMER LIST](https://rltracker.pro/scam_list) before trading with anyone.\n\nThis has been a highly requested post and I'm pleased to announce I've finally got round to it. Not much introduction is needed, so without further ado, here is\n\n#HOW NOT TO GET SCAMMED\n\nThe following is a list of common scams, and how to counter them. This list will be updated as time goes on. If you know of any other scams, don't hesitate to pm me and I'll add them to the list.\n\n------------\n\n##1\\. Fake Middleman (different types)\n\nThis has always been a popular scam since MM were around. In simple terms, the scammer has a friend they are working with. The friend owns an account with a name similar to a MM but not the exact same. For example, take the PS4 MM with the PSN account wink**L**aar04 (with a L if that wasn't obvious enough). A scammer could make the PSN wink**I**aar04 (with an I) and pretend to be the real MM. The scammer invites you and his friend to the lobby and before you know it, they've walked away with your Turtle Pigeon Topper or whatever it is you memers are manipulating ^^^/s nowadays. \n\n###How To Avoid Getting Scammed By A Fake MM:\n\nALWAYS USE THE [OFFICIAL MM LIST](https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLeagueExchange/comments/7flgom/official_trusted_middleman_thread/) THAT IS ON THE SIDEBAR OF THE SUB AND ALSO THE FIRST STICKIED POST\n\nDO NOT TRUST **ANY** SCREENSHOTS OF A LIST AS THEY ARE LIKELY EDITED. ALWAYS VERIFY THE CORRECT MM IS IN YOUR LOBBY BY PMING THEM ON REDDIT. All our MM will be happy to pm you confirming they are in your lobby.\n\n\"But Af,\" you say, \"iT wAS geK WhO sCAmMEd mE\"\n\nNo it wasn't.\n\n####NB: Scammers go to huge lengths to fake MM whether it's through screenshots, impersonator accounts, or even subs that impersonate ours (yes that's a thing). [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLeagueExchange/comments/7fli4p/meta_middleman_call_megathread/) is a guide Aero put on how to 'call' a MM.\n\n-------\n##2\\. Fake Reputation\n\nAnother popular scam around right now involves the reputation of larger (and even smaller) traders on our sub. The scammer has several ways of stealing rep. One such way is making an impersonator Reddit account of someone with a lot of rep. Like with the previous scam, a similar looking name is used and the scammer sends you a link to the actual person's reputation claiming it is their own. \n\nAnother way of stealing rep is where the scammer makes a website to impersonate RLE and edits their name onto someone else's reputation. This is harder to spot as the scammer could have a completely different name to the person whose reputation they are stealing and still pass off that rep as their own. \n\n###How To Avoid Getting Scammed By Fake Rep:\n\nALWAYS DOUBLE **AND** TRIPLE CHECK WHO IS MESSAGING YOU AND THE 'OWNER' OF THE REP THEY ARE SENDING TO YOU. MAKE SURE YOU ARE ACTUALLY ON https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLeagueExchange AND NOT SOME DODGY THIRD PARTY WEBSITE. ONCE AGAIN NEVER TRUST SCREENSHOTS AS THEY ARE LIKELY EDITED. JUST BECAUSE THEY HAVE SOME WASHED UP WANNABE YOUTUBER ON THEIR FRIENDS LIST, IT DOES NOT MEAN THEY ARE TRUSTWORTHY. USE YOUR COMMON SENSE.\n\nHonestly, it's not hard to avoid getting scammed by fake rep. It takes a max of 5 seconds to click on the account name and check it is not a brand new account with no activity. Get it right people.\n\n---------\n##3\\. The Colour Switch \n\nThis is a sly one. It involves a trader (usually from RLGarage ^^^sorrynotsorry ) whose asking price for a painted item is slightly less than the going price. For example, say a painted item is 50 Keys, they may ask for 30 and say it's a quicksell. When they get down to trade with you they will put up the item, let's say it's white in this case, and then wait for you to put your items. They will then ask if you have any adds and while you're distracted looking for the adds or telling them 'No way!' they will quickly swap out the white item for a grey one. The colours look quite similar so it is easy to assume the item is still white and accept the trade. The scammer can also rapidly select and unselect the white item then quickly select the grey item in place of the white one.\n\n###How To Avoid Getting Scammed By The Colour Switch:\n\nPRESS SHOW DETAILS FOR THE ITEM THEY ARE TRADING WHEN THEY HAVE HIT ACCEPT. 'SHOW DETAILS' CAN BE FOUND WITH L3 ON PS4 AND LEFT STICK ON XBOX. IF THEY UNACCEPT THEN WAIT FOR THEM TO REACCEPT BEFORE LOOKING AT WHAT COLOUR THE ITEM IS. IF THEY ARE DOING SOME DODGY SELECTING AND UNSELECTING, NOPE OUT OF THERE.\n\nI have nothing to say about this one it's pretty self explanatory tbh. There are several ways of them distracting you, not just limited to the one I have said. Another common method is to send you a message through PSN/Xbox/Steam and while you open that, switch the item. \n-------\n\n##4\\. Certification Glitch\n\nAs the name says, this scam involves the glitch whereby the certification of an item 'doesn't show'. The scammer claims the item they are selling is certified when it is not. They could send you a photoshopped screenshot etc, there was even some guy who added a cert with text on Snapchat... \n\nObviously the uncertified item is worth less than the certified item unless the cert is acrobat because lets be honest, who really wants an acrobat cert item? \n\n###How To Avoid Getting Scammed By The Certification Glitch:\n\nDO NOT TRUST SCREENSHOTS OF CERTS. THEY CAN BE EASILY FAKED. THE LONG SOLUTION TO THE CERT GLITCH IS TO GET THE PERSON YOU ARE TRADING WITH TO REMOVE THE ITEM FROM ALL PRESETS AND RESTART RL, HOWEVER THAT'S SO MUCH EFFORT. INSTEAD, ALWAYS USE A MIDDLEMAN (see point 1 on avoiding MM impersonators). IF SOMEONE IS ASKING FOR 5 KEYS ON TOP OF A WHITE ZOMBA FOR A STRIKER WHITE ZOMBA THAT'S PROBABLY A SCAMMER OR SOME NOOB.\n\nPsyonix pls. Fix this. It's easily doable. \n\n-------\n\n##5\\. Rewards!\n\nYou've been watching the streams for 3 days in a row now. You don't even like Rocket League. You just want the free grand that comes with a Striker White Apex. You open RL and see an unpainted dominus decal. You don't even have the dominus dlc. [This](https://giphy.com/gifs/reaction-1tZ4Coe9v2H8A) is you (I'm too lazy to edit the words Striker and White and Apex on that gif). In desperation you search Google for Rocket League rewards. You enter your login details onto some dodgy website that claims to get you offline rewards. [&gt;:O](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6rZfpSL1RQ)\n\nIf you haven't yet realised, what I'm so eloquently saying is that this scam involves you entering your details onto a 'rewards' site, only it's not a 'rewards' site, it's a scammer owned site that takes your login details and steals items from your account.\n\n###How To Avoid Getting Scammed By Fake Rewards Websites:\n\nDON'T SIGN IN TO **ANY** WEBSITES OTHER THAN [THE LEGIT REWARDS SITE](http://rewards.rocketleague.com/). EVEN IF THEY PROMISE YOU 10 STRIKER WHITE APEXES AND TICKETS TO JUSTIN BIEBER'S CONCERT DO NOT SIGN IN.\n\nAs you can tell I'm starting to get more relaxed and informal as I'm typing this so expect to see more **hilarious** gifs. [Me as I'm typing this](https://giphy.com/gifs/reactiongifs-11nloJQzzDP1MA).\n\n-------\n\n##6\\. RLCS Decal Scam\n\nThis is a lesser known one and also less popular. The RLCS decals do not show which car body they belong to when more than 8 items are in the trade window. The scams involves you, the na\u00efve trader, wanting a RLCS decal for a certain car. Let's say you wanted a White RLCS Decal for the Octane as that is the most expensive. Mr/Mrs. Scammer comes along to trade with you and boy oh boy they are feeling generous today. [Relevant anime gif for you weeaboos](https://giphy.com/gifs/funimation-SdhZORlml48I8). Because the scammer is such a nice person they are willing to throw in a few crates just for you. Can you believe it?? Get that discussion post ready because generous traders=free karma. Anyways, they offer exactly 8 crates which are put in the trade window first. The 9^th item is the decal. You can see where this is going. The item is definitely white not grey and you have checked yourself using point number 3. You press accept and once again you done messed up because you now have a White RLCS Decal for the Breakout Type S. Yes not even the regular Breakout but the Type S version ew.\n\n###How To Avoid Getting Scammed By The RLCS Decal Scam:\n\nIF SOMEONE IS WILLING TO ADD CRATES OR OTHER ITEMS TELL THEM TO FIRST TRADE THE DECAL ONLY FOR YOUR END OF THE DEAL, THEN GIVE YOU THE CRATES/ITEMS IN A SECOND TRADE FOR FREE. IF THEY REFUSE, LEAVE. \n\nThis is not very popular as RLCS decals aren't high in demand and not traded that often. Let's hope these new rewards bring decals that show the body they are intended for.\n\n-----\n\n##7\\. PayPal Invoice\n\nNow I'm not sure if this scam is still a thing any more but I'll go over it briefly anyways. The scammer will ask to trade with you and offer PayPal. They even *want* to go first and offer to send the PayPal in good faith. [D:](https://www.theflagshop.co.uk/media/catalog/product/cache/1/thumbnail/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/r/e/red-flag-std_1.jpg)\n\nWhat they actually do is send you a PayPal invoice and once you see the money money money and official email from PayPal you give the scammer your items. RIP.\n\n###How To Avoid Getting Scammed By PayPal Invoices: \n\nLEARN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN AN INVOICE AND AN ACTUAL PAYMENT. YOUR BALANCE GOES UP AFTER A PAYMENT NOT DOWN. THE MONEY SHOULD BE IN YOUR PAYPAL ACCOUNT WITHOUT YOU HAVING TO DO ANYTHING (in rare cases you may have to accept payments).\n\nNo little anecdote with this one I'm afraid. Pretty self-explanatory.\n\n-----\n\n##8\\. DDOSing\n\nNot only is this one of the most scummy types of scam, it is also illegal. The scammer in this situation appears to do everything by the book. They do not call a fake MM, or try to pull a colour switch or anything else. Instead, they ask you to join a PSN/Xbox voice party with them. Through methods that I won't go through, they find out your IP address. Using this, they can 'shut down' your internet and also find out your general vicinity (ie the city you live in). Once they have your IP they threaten to shut down your internet unless you hand over all your items to them. \n\n###How to Avoid Getting DDOSed:\n\nDO NOT JOIN ANY PARTY ON PSN OR STEAM WITH PEOPLE THAT YOU DO NOT KNOW. FURTHERMORE, DO NOT CLICK ON ANY DODGY LINKS THAT A RANDOM PERSON HAS SENT YOU (whether that's through Reddit, PS messages etc). IF YOU ARE ON A DESKTOP YOU CAN HOVER OVER ANY LINKS PEOPLE HAVE SENT AND IT SHOULD SAY WHERE THE LINK LEADS TO. IF SOMEONE DOES FIND OUT YOUR IP ADDRESS, UNPLUG YOUR ROUTER FOR A FEW MINUTES. WHEN YOU SWITCH IT BACK ON YOUR IP SHOULD BE CHANGED. IF THE PROBLEMS PERSIST, CALL YOUR INTERNET PROVIDER AND EXPLAIN THE SITUATION. \n\nAs you can see there are no gifs/reference videos to go with this scam because it is very serious. Most of the people affected by this scam are kids with little knowledge of what is happening. It is, in my opinion, the most horrible type of scam around.\n\n------\n\n##9\\. The Duplication Glitch\n\n[Old School KSI for reference](https://youtu.be/AhMF6yFBRjg). \n\n###How To Avoid Getting Scammed By The Duplication Glitch:\n\nTHERE IS NO DUPLICATION GLITCH.\n\nI'm not being lazy, that's all there is to say.\n\n-----\n\n##10\\. Over 24 Crates\n\nDue to Psyonix's blessings we are only allowed to trade 24 items in one go (this was introduced to counter one of the most popular scams that is no longer possible). However, this has led to a new type of scam whereby someone asks for over 24 crates for an expensive item, such as heatwave, and asks that you send 24 crates first, then the rest for the heatwave. This is not Canada. This is the internet. The scammer obviously will not give you a heatwave for 30 of your worthless Overdrive Crates. Jeez.\n\n###How To Avoid Getting Scammed By The Item Limit:\n\nALWAYS USE A MM FOR TRADES WHERE THEY ARE REQUIRED. DO NOT TRUST RANDOMS OFF RLGARAGE WHO PUT IN THEIR DESCRIPTIONS 24 CRATES FIRST. IF SOMEONE DOES NOT WANT TO USE A MM FOR **ANY** REASON AND ASKS YOU TO GO FIRST, BACK OUT OF THAT TRADE STRAIGHT AWAY AND REPORT THEM TO US WITH THE APPROPRIATE EVIDENCE. WE WILL TAKE ACTION ACCORDINGLY. \n\nCredit to /u/SidewinderN7. I didn't want to put this scam on here as I believe anyone who falls for this kind of scam won't even know of this guide, but I was convinced otherwise \u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af\n\n-------\n\n##11\\. Fake Overpay\n\nThis one's on the fence of being a scam or just abusing people's unintelligence/greed (they can be interchangeable :/). A scammer offers to trade something expensive for a niche (and inexpensive) item that you probably don't own. A few minutes after you promise you'll be the knight in shining armour, a random person you don't know has that item. Instead of connecting the two traders you spot an opportunity. You accept that this random wants an overpay and pay more than the item is worth (eg the scammer wants to trade their heatwave for a turtle plunger, his friend has a Turtle Plunger for 5 keys and you have an innocent mind and believe in the Tooth Fairy). Lo and behold, the original trader does a Pablo Escobar and is nowhere to be found and you've paid 5 keys for a Turtle Plunger.\n\n###How To Avoid Falling For The Fake Overpay:\n\nINSTEAD OF RUSHING INTO THE TRADE THINK ABOUT THINGS. PUT SOME FOCUS MUSIC ON SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO LATER CRY TO THAT [ONE EMOTIONAL SONG](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cH4jXFX47Zg). IF THEY HAVE A HEATWAVE WOULD THEY REALLY WANT A TURTLE CERT PLUNGER?? WOULD THEY???\n\nThat song may hit some of you in the feels.\n\n------\n\nThat concludes my guide on how not to get scammed folks. This guide will be updated if necessary. Let me know if I have missed any scams and I'll do my best to find the relevant gifs/videos. If you feel emotionally scarred by that last video, just know it gets better. You'll find another Korean internet wife. \n\nKeep an eye out for more guides in the future and be sure to let me or any of the other mods know if you need a guide for anything else. \n\n#Once again the most important thing is to do a quick search of [The Global Scam List](https://rltracker.pro/scam_list). \n\n##Finally, if it's too good to be true it probably is.\n\nBe safe, and happy trading!\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\nEdit: ty to /u/CitySoul13 for popping my gold cherry, I don\u2019t really know what gold does but I [appreciate it](https://giphy.com/gifs/mrw-cute-girl-tCSFvcIyz7qk8) ","thumbnail":"self","date":"2018-02-03","time":"00:24:05","is_self":"true","score":"138","author":"af2300","subreddit":"RocketLeagueExchange","subreddit_id":"t5_3g4tc","rn":"1"}

Here it is.\n\n---\n\nSo the goal of this scam is to get you to enter your credentials into a site owned by the owner, who will then take everything in your inventory.\n\nLike most of the people here I block people that have private inventories but most of these guys will not have them. They will offer to buy your value skin for either a reasonable price or slightly over price. Only they have one thing, they need an asset id from your skin before they will trade.\n\nWhat is asset id you might ask? Well, it's a real thing, so if you search around you can actually find it. However, you aren't gonna see it on metjem or anything like that. They will, of course, offer you a convenient link to a site that will pull an asset id for you.\n\nHowever this site is controlled by the guy on the other end. [For example, heres a site I was linked today by a scammer.](https://i.gyazo.com/0ef05742edcd87258fcfd21b6532cc05.png) How kind, a steam login link, steam logins are secure, we use those all the time Alpaca.\n\nWell when you click on this link, it pulls up a screen that is an exact copy of the steam login screen. [However, this is not actually hosted on steams server, it's hosted on the trading csgo site](https://i.gyazo.com/97462a49c53630929ed35da3f63b77c8.png). It actually attempts to hide this from you by making it hard to open the page source.\n\n**NEVER SIGN IN WITH YOUR STEAM CREDENTIALS NOT ON THE STEAM COMMUNITY SITE**\n\n[OPSkins Valid Steam Login](https://i.gyazo.com/75cc5da7cd64ae8a0be117eaadfa2c6c.png)\n\nVs.\n\n[TradingCSGO Phishing Login](https://i.gyazo.com/5ed2fc7768eb0838fd5776ad9d07cd7a.png)\n\n---\n\nAlways make sure that you are on the Steam Community site with a verified SSL certificate from \"Valve Corp. [US]\". If you have cookies enabled, your credentials should auto fill in on actual steam sites.\n\nI was linked two separate but similar sites that both worked this way. \n\nStay safe friends. go fest))","thumbnail":"self","date":"2018-02-05","time":"01:42:09","is_self":"true","score":"53","author":"TehAlpacalypse","subreddit":"GlobalOffensiveTrade","subreddit_id":"t5_2y6r4","rn":"3"}

I am wondering why in the case of the uncommons are the retired items considered less?\n\nHere is the conversation I have had numerous times after making an offer with either tunicas or dieci.\n\nTRADER: Are they exotic?\n\nME: No uncommon.\n\nTRADER: Add please, exotic are worth more\n\nME: Why are PCC zombas worth less than CC Zombas?\n\nTRADER: The CC are retired\n\nME: The uncommons are retired\n\nTRADER: .... *leaves*\n\nI understand that \"Exotic\" sounds nicer than \"uncommon\" but lets just keep things consistent. \n\n\nEDIT so it looks like the only reason exotic are more is because it eliminates any accidental trade up ","thumbnail":"self","date":"2018-02-05","time":"20:40:34","is_self":"true","score":"50","author":"bigdefmute","subreddit":"RocketLeagueExchange","subreddit_id":"t5_3g4tc","rn":"2"}

His kids were not interested in stocks but are hooked onto cryptocurrencies, and the government has to respect that, and develop a positive outlook.  \n\n2. While scams and fraudsters must be cracked down, the general market must be allowed to develop. A working group of SEC, FINCEN, CFTC and other group members are working on identifying scams in this space.\n\n3. When asked if Crypto has any \"intrinsic value\"? - There is an intrinsic value and relation of the value of bitcoin and the cost of mining it. \n\n4. Price of Bitcoin is just one publicly traded company like McDonalds. In comparison, global money supply is 7.6T. And since Bitcoin has been compared to digital gold, value of all gold in the world is 8T.\n\n\n5. HOLY SHT.. He just mentioned \"HODL\". Hahaha - According to him its \"Hold on for dear life\". \n\n\"We must crack down hard on those who abuse our young enthusiasm for bitcoin and blockchain technology\"\n\n\"We owe it to this new generation, to respect their interest in this new technology with a thoughtful regulatory approach.\"  \n\n----\n\nIn the middle of all this Senator Brown was constantly bashing banks, a topic un-related to all the discussion. Apparently banks have had 80+ violations in the recent months. Lol  \n\n\n-----\nOther points:  \n\n- No of times drug dealing mentioned in the proceedings = 0  \n\n- No of times terrorism mentioned in the proceedings - Venezuela Petrocoin and Russia Cryptorouble (and North Korea) were discussed - they were seen as ways these countries could use crypto assets to skirt US sanctions. Though the SEC chair addressed that there was not much they could do, but are working with Feds and the treasury. \n\n- \"illegal transactions\" was discussed, and the steps taken to combat misuse of crypto.  \n\n\n\n##Update:  \n\nThis is another Nebraska Legislative hearing on Bitcoin bill which is live now:\n\nhttp://netnebraska.org/interactive-multimedia/government/legislative-hearing-banking-commerce-and-insurance-room-1507-55\n\n","thumbnail":"self","date":"2018-02-06","time":"15:43:50","is_self":"true","score":"7957","author":"ethswagholder","subreddit":"CryptoCurrency","subreddit_id":"t5_2wlj3","rn":"3"}

Usually with not many actions to come after the latest paper form from Valve to the gambling providers. \n\n\nNow things seem to turn. At the very least for the Danish market, where Internet operators starts to ban the access to skin gambling pages due to a regulation that the authorities made. In this particular example, two of the biggest providers are affected, while it will most likely end up with affecting all providers.\n\nSources:\n\nhttps://www.business.dk/digital/24-spillesider-faar-adgang-forbudt-for-danskerne?referrer=RSS (danish)\n\nhttps://nordjyske.dk/nyheder/teleselskaber-faar-besked-paa-at-lukke-for-skinbetting-sider/f1f97420-57de-4560-831d-4e76fe81eefc#cxrecs_s (danish)\n\n\nNow allthough those webpages will most like be accessable through VPN's and similar options, this will still be a great hit towards skin gambling as most minors are not aware of such options. From this day today Skin gambling will be illegal and will require a license from the Danish authorities. \n\n\nThis brings me to the question: What are your thoughts in this, and how do you think that this will affect the rest of the world and their view onto this business? Personally I know this is a billion dollar industry, and by personal belief I can't concur with offering gambling to minors that are yet to develop a filter of understanding the consequences of their actions.

I just want people to know that I'm still alive. The alias, aside from these guides, is dead.*\n\nSo, even though posts have been made on trade-ups before, it seems as though there is still misunderstanding as to how they work as I see people showing incorrect values on tradeups that are actually lower risk then thought to be. Furthermore, I want to make it more clear to people exactly how float values themselves work, along with how they work in tradeups.\n\n**This guide is not meant for most seasoned traders that frequently use tradeups, this is for people who are newer, intermediate level, or do frequent trading but are interested in learning about how floats work in this stupid game.**\n\n##Furthermore, if this guide receives positive reception, I will go ahead and finish off my update for the trade guide I promised you all ^over ^a ^year ^ago.\n\nI've included footnotes and a mini index so as to not intrude on the beautiful structuring.\n&gt; \n&gt; 1.0 The Basics of the Trade Up Contract\n&gt; \n&gt; 1.1 How Chances are Determined in the Trade Up Contract\n&gt; \n&gt; 1.2 Float Values in a Nutshell\n&gt; \n&gt; 1.3 Calculating Floats in Tradeups\n&gt; \n&gt; 1.4 Conclusion\n\n###1.0 Basics of the Trade Up Contract\n\n* The obvious: a tradeup contract is a virtual contract within *Counter-Strike: Global Offensive* wherein a user inputs 10 skins of any rarity except for *Covert*.^1\n* The skins can be from any collection *and* it can be *StatTrak^TM* or non-*StatTrak^TM*, however; *StatTrak^TM* and non-*StatTrak^TM* weapons may not be used in a tradeup at the same time.\n* Souvenir weapons may not be used at all in trade-up contracts. I know that you want that Souvenir Dlore, but you don't deserve it.^2\n* PatternID is completely randomized, as is the weapon you receive, although your chance of getting said item is calculatable.\n* Float value is 100% calculatable and predictable.^3\n\n###1.1 How Chances are Determined in the Trade Up Contract\nThis is still something that a lot of people are unsure of, although it isn't really subject to debate. I want this information to be more clear to people so that some site devs whom might see this post can properly update their calculation algorithms, and so that those who are unaware know what the most accurate information is.^4\n\n##How people think the Trade Up Contract works.\n* You have a pool of 10 skins, from which 1 is selected upon hitting \"Submit.\"\n* From the selected skin, one of the possible outcomes from that is selected.\n* This implies that, if you have 9 skins with 1 outcome, and one skin with 4 outcomes, that there is a 10% chance that the 1 unique skin is picked and a 25% chance for each of those outcomes to be picked, resulting in an overall 2.5% chance for one of the said desired skins.\n* The odds would look like this, assuming the first 9 skins all have one outcome and the last has four outcomes: [10% + 10% + 10% + 10% + 10% + 10% + 10% + 10% + 10% + *(2.5% + 2.5% + 2.5% + 2.5%)*]\n* **This is incorrect.**\n\n##How the Trade Up Contract *Actually* Works\n* You have 10 parent skins, each of which have possible trade-up results that are added to a pool. Each skin's results are collectively added to the pool.\n* Upon hitting \"Submit\", a skin is randomly chosen from the pool, completely ignoring the 10 original skins you have provided.\n* This implies that, if you have 9 skins with 1 outcome, and one skin with 4 outcomes, that *there is actually a 7.69% chance for any of the possible skins, since 1\u00f713 is ~7.69%. This is because there are not 10 parent skins, but* actually *the 13 possible outcome skins to pick from. Furthermore, this simply means that if one skin appears more than once, you just add up the percentages representing the amount of times it shows up. Since there are 9 of the first skin, it means that there is a 69.23% chance of getting it.*\n* The odds would look like this, assuming the first 9 skins all have one outcome and the last has four outcomes: [7.69% + 7.69% + 7.69% + 7.69% + 7.69% + 7.69% + 7.69% + 7.69% + 7.69% + *(7.69% + 7.69% + 7.69% + 7.69%)*]\n* **This is correct.**\n\n###1.2 Float Values in a Nutshell\n\nSo, what is a float value? To rip from my last guide;\n\n&gt; A float value (Or Floating Point) is a static numeric string used in programming to set a value for whatever purpose is correct in context. In the case of CS:GO, the float value of an item determines the amount of wear it has (relative to the pattern seed's wear placement.) Basically, higher float skins have worse wears (Battle-Scarred through Field-Tested) and lower float skins have better wears (Field-Tested through Factory New.)\n&gt; \n&gt; The Float ranges for items are as follows:\n&gt; \n&gt; 0 - 0.069 = Factory New\n\n&gt; 0.07 - 0.149 = Minimal Wear\n\n&gt; 0.15 - 0.379 = Field-Tested\n\n&gt; 0.38 - 0.449 = Well-Worn\n\n&gt; 0.45 - 1.00 = Battle-Scarred\n\nHowever, back then I didn't know as much as I do now, and I'd like to clarify a few things/make them more obvious;\n\n* CS:GO, like most other modern games, utilizes the [iEEE 754 Standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754), which is, in its shortest form, an interpretation of binary values in a decimal system. Computer numbers are not infinite, and are limited by real values. What this means is that a float value can not be any random string of numbers, rather it is one of over two billion binary values that are converted to a decimal so that they become human readable.\n* Individual skins may have different minimums and maximums overall (i.e. Hyper beast goes from 0.00 - 1.00, whereas Crimson Webs go from 0.06 - 0.80)\n\nSo what this means is that the wear ranges actually look like this, in exact values:\n\n    0.000000000000000000000000000 - 0.06999999284744262695312500 = Factory New\n    \n    0.070000000298023223876953125 - 0.14999999105930328369140625 = Minimal Wear\n    \n    0.150000005960464477539062500 - 0.37999999523162841796875000 = Field-Tested\n    \n    0.380000025033950805664062500 - 0.44999998807907104492187500 = Well-Worn\n    \n    0.450000017881393432617187500 - 1.00000000000000000000000000 = Battle-Scarred\n\n##Wait, wasn't a Nova Predator dropped with a float below its minimum of 0.06?\nTo us, yes. But mathematically, believe it or not, it is technically actually still above a float of 0.06. In one of McSkillet's recent videos, he calls the 0.059999998 Nova predator the result of a \"Rounding Error/Glitch.\" **This is not correct.** The float system actually worked 100% as intended, since 0.0599999986588954925537109375 is actually equal to 0.0600000000000000000 (the system rounds down since rounding up is a larger difference). This is because, like with the float ranges, these binary values represent regular intervals of real decimal values, which means that 0.0600000000000000000 is not a \"real\" number, but 0.0599999986588954925537109375 is! What this does mean though, is that the Nova Predator with a 0.0599999986588954925537109375 float was dropped with a float value so close to 0.06, that when it was converted, it was rounded down to what is the equivalent to zero. **What this means is that this is the only item in the game (aside from the no-star Karambit) with a 0 float value.**\n\nTl;dr The nova is the result of a system behaving in an intended way, but producing an unintended result. AKA an exploit.\n\n###1.3 Calculating Floats in Tradeups\n\nThe final section of the guide. Calculating float values in the trade-up contract is quite easy, thanks to the popular extension \"SteamWizard\" which allows users to select items of their choosing directly on the market or from the inventory. This will calculate trade up's float outcome for you, but since I like to be thorough I'm going to do it anyway. **Also note that CSGOZone and SteamWizard are CURRENTLY the only two resources that properly show percentages and float values for the trade up contract.**\n\nThis is by far the easiest part of the guide. In short, the average float of the 10 skins you put into the trade up determines the outcome's float value, no strings attached. This calculation also entirely ignores the minimums and maximums of the input items.\n\nThe only time the minimums and maximums matter is on the output item. If you have an average float outcome of 0.005, but your chosen outcome skin has a float cap of 0.06, then what happens? Simple, the float value is simply re-calculated on a relative level.\n\nLet's say your outcome skin has caps at 0.06 and 0.80, this is what happens;\n\n* The float value is 'compressed' to fit the new float range, which is 74% (0.80 - 0.06 = 0.74) of the regular float cap. \n* 0.005 x 0.74 = 0.0037\n* 0.0037 is still invalid, so we need to add the float cap minimum to this item. \n* 0.0037 + 0.06 = 0.0637\n* Therefore, if your average float of the 10 input skins is 0.005, and the output skin is capped at 0.06 and 0.80, then the outcome float will be 0.0637.\n* Tl;dr *avg(max-min)+min*\n\nIt's really that simple.\n\n###1.4 Conclusion\nNumbers suck. Hope that this guide helps to inform some people, or at least clear up some previously confusing things. All of this information will be included in my upcoming trade guide, this is just something that I feel should be under a magnifying glass a bit more.\n\n###Footnotes\n^1 Some collections don't possess Covert weapons, for these collections; the highest rarity is the cutoff.\n\n^2 Except maybe for Kiss-CSGO, that guy comments incredibly often and it blows my mind\n\n^3 Pecker has discovered that not all float values behave as predicted. There is a chance (although unlikely) that you may receive a float value ever so slightly higher or lower than expected, due to iEEE 754 conversion.\n\n^4 Since we do not have access to the code on the item servers, this has only been proven speculatively via the use of many trade-ups. Both myself and other users have verified that this information is mathematically scaled mostly accurately to the real world tests, and will likely look more accurate with larger sample sizes. I have personally completed over 150 trade ups and the accuracy to the theoretical calculations I demonstrate here is close to 100%, so it is safe to say that this method is the actual one CS:GO uses.","thumbnail":"self","date":"2018-02-09","time":"03:20:59","is_self":"true","score":"221","author":"KokonutCrazy","subreddit":"GlobalOffensiveTrade","subreddit_id":"t5_2y6r4","rn":"1"}

I am a PS4 player and back in early December was the first time I bought keys from someone for my Paypal. That person was /u/SuperMeatStick1. At the time, he had his Striker Crimson Apex Wheels on. I fell in love with them the second I saw them and though there would never be anyway I would be able to purchase them. I then had the idea to see if he would allow be to put the wheels on layaway and he did not have a problem with that. We decided to do 12 payments of $50 or 59 keys ($600 or 705 keys).

During the course of the two months of payments, it did not cross my mind once that I am getting scammed.  /u/SuperMeatStick1 is without a doubt the most trustworthy person I have met while playing and trading in Rocket League. For only knowing each other for about 2 weeks before this trade happened, he could have easily walked away after I gave him a majority of the payments.However, he did not and for that reason, I now trust /u/SuperMeatStick1 in future trades we may have, holding items or keys for me if ever needed, and Middlemanning for any trades that I might have. \nTHANKYOU SUPERMEATSTICK1 FOR THE AWESOME WHEELS","thumbnail":"self","date":"2018-02-11","time":"01:51:03","is_self":"true","score":"120","author":"kkkorsakkk","subreddit":"RocketLeagueExchange","subreddit_id":"t5_3g4tc","rn":"2"}

Backstory: I met this girl on the Snow Day playlist. We kept going back and forth a lot in the chat and in the game, and were the only two people who had our actual picture as our gamerpics. After adding each other, it was a little while before we played again. As a kind gesture, I wanted to give her a few flower antennas upon meeting again, and she happily accepted them and told me it was just as cute as my accent. I kept up with giving her a flower everyday for a week, and we never skipped a day of playing with each other. We grew really close and had a ton of fun within such a short amount of time, and I knew she was important to me. But then I realized Valentine's day was fast approaching, and I definitely had to get her a gift that she would absolutely love. I spent a lot of time here and on r/lowtiertradingrl to put together the list you see above, and so many people were so kind about lending a hand to make this all possible. So then today finally comes... Instead of giving her a flower, I gave her a painted Hawaiian Lei, and told her \"I don't have a flower for you at the moment so here's this instead\" kind of thing. We played a couple games and I was waiting for her dog to calm down so I could speak to her uninterrupted. Then I made the move. I told her to hit accept and to close her eyes while I filled up the trade window. I then told her it was okay to look. She was completely in shock, and was in tears, unable to put words together. I then explained the significance of everything:\n\n* I got you the Tora, because you were hard to find, like a black market decal (her first one)\n\n* I got you the Jager, because I find you really attractive (she's been wanting this 'sexy' car for a while)\n\n* I got you the treasure Boost, because I treasure having you (also showed her the easter egg with it, don't worry)\n\n* I got you the royal crown because you're my princess\n\n* I got you the heart glasses, because we both have hearts in our eyes when we see each other\n\n* I got you the heart banner, because I don't care who sees how much we like each other\n\n* I got you the little dog, because it's cute like you and our puppy love \n\n* And Kalos wheels, because I need you to just roll with the last one\n\nShe then tried throwing a lot of crates at me (she calls them boxes and knows I like them) and I told her that I wanted nothing in return. She then accepted the trade after so many thank yous and ohmygods. She read the stuff out loud just to make sure I knew she got everything, and when 'undying love' came up, she started crying more and told me how lucky she was. At this point, I started getting emotional too because it meant more to her than I thought it would. I traded her the bows last, to tie it all together, and she then made her car with the gifts I gave her. After a little bit, and some fine customization, she invited me to a trade, and put up a candle and a rose. I put up \"friction\" in the trade window, and we had a really good laugh over that. I can't even begin to tell you how happy this makes me and she's been completely ecstatic since then and has been all smiles. I really appreciate all the people who helped make this amazing for us both and I hope everyone has a fantastic time playing rocket league with their friends and loved ones tonight! Happy Valentine's day!\n\n* Edit: Check out my last clip on my GT if you wanna see it in action! I'll upload more pics soon :) \n\n* Edit II: Took down the pic because it had my phone number revealed, but you can see in the post that a few of the people I traded with have commented, please show them some love :)","thumbnail":"self","date":"2018-02-15","time":"02:02:59","is_self":"true","score":"131","author":"S1LV3RH00D","subreddit":"RocketLeagueExchange","subreddit_id":"t5_3g4tc","rn":"1"}

The color just popped off the wheel, the treads lit up like a neon sign and they created this glow that I could not take my eyes off of, much to the dismay of my random teammates who kindly suggested I remove the game from my console. \n\nI couldnt believe it, these horrifically mangled eye sores were actually gorgeous as I was driving around. To see if it was a fluke, I tried them out again, and I felt the same draw to them. I had to get more. I quickly traded for a Lime set for the blue side, and I had the same reaction. \n\nSo here I am, wonderments in the garage, and I'm working on a set of the ugliest wheels many of you have seen. It almost hurts to see all the posts on here of people wanting to die because they crated these, or even openly exclaiming how ugly they are in a trading post to warn the buyers. Well, it would hurt a lot more if all the hate didnt keep the prices down for me.\n\nSo, now I need vindication, I need to feel like I am not alone here, even though maybe I am. Someone, anyone, please dont be shy and join me in open admiration of ugly Rocket League items. Please. \n\n\n*****\ntl;dr I have been told you need to read this.

I get absolutely furious over the idea the government can give information that belongs to the public to their favorite pet reporters as a quid pro quo for flattering coverage while denying access to the average person who wants to read the information directly for themselves. \n\nBasically this system means the government is aiding the media in it's ability to enslave the public by forcing us to rely on the press exclusively for information about the mechanics of our own government. This is fucking infuriating. \n\nYou can see this same \"you scratch my back, I'll scratch yours\" in the Wikileaks Clinton emails. In exchange to access to Clinton the media agreed to ask soft ball questions, write flattering pieces and basically act as her cheerleaders. The difference is the campaign had every right to use access to Clinton as a bargaining chip for positive coverage. In what world does the fucking federal bureaucracy have the right to use information about **OUR GOVERNMENT** in order to bargain for good coverage? That information doesn't belong to the CIA, or to the fucking permanent bureaucrat class, it belong to CITIZENS. It's our fucking information about our fucking government.

The guy that owns it now said he only bought it off the Steam Market for around $90 which is a nice price. I really hope I can get it back!!\n\n\n#EDIT / UPDATE\n\n\nMe and /u/kerashu have been talking and since he hasn't been playing as often he said he'd give the awp to me as a gift, we are exchanging awps and are planning on switching whenever we feel like playing with the different awp skins. I am very grateful to find someone this chill and nice, and I'm glad he's willing to be a trusted friend. Thank you all for the upvotes, I've never seen anything like this happen before!

I\u2019ve been frantically scanning through RLE, RLG and a bunch of trading groups on Facebook. Haven\u2019t found one single seller anywhere. \n\n\nToday I finally found them on RLG. Since the uncert go for around 10+ keys, I was prepared to pay around 30-35k. Not too high, but still a good offer I think. \n\n\nThe guy on RLG was asking 10k for striker-cert, so I\u2019m thinking it\u2019s either a fake post or an obvious scam attempt. \n\n\nI invite the guy and sure enough, the cert doesn\u2019t show. Not even with L3. Just as I was expecting. The guy keeps insisting they\u2019re cert though.\n\n\nNormally I would just leave the party, but in this case I thought... well, fuck it, 10k isn\u2019t THAT bad of a deal even if they\u2019re uncert so why not.\n\nI accept the trade, and holy cow! They\u2019re actually striker cert! \nHe thanked me for believing in him, I thanked him for being honest and we parted ways. \n\n\nI don\u2019t know if it makes me happier that I got such an awesome deal or that there\u2019s actually at least one honest person on RLG, but I thought I\u2019d share :) Today was a good day. \n\nAlso...

I'll keep this brief.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Rundown of the Process**\n\n1) Someone asks you to visit a phishing site, or you search on Google and click on a phishing ad.\n\n2) You click \"Sign in with Steam.\"\n\n3) A new frame/popup/tab opens, and it does not say \"steamcommunity.com\" in the navigation bar. No \"Valve Corp [US]\" SSL indicator in the navigation bar. This is a replicated page that's logging anything you enter in the login/password fields.\n\n4) You enter login credentials, it asks for Steam mobile guard code. You enter the code, **but you are not sending this data to Steamcommunity.com**.\n\n5) Using (4), the attacker can log into your Steam account until the Mobile guard code expires (~60 seconds). **They can now access/modify/perform actions on your behalf on Steam** (except *confirm* trades).\n\n6) You get trade requests from *anyone* in which you send items? The trade now gets cancelled by the attacker, and they immediately send you another trade offer with the same profile name, trade offer message, and list of items.\n\n7) You think (6) is legitimate since you were expecting a trade offer from that entity, you confirm the trade.\n\n8) You have just sent your items to the attacker. The scam is complete and will repeat as long as your Steam profile is accessible to the attacker. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**If you're clicking strangers' links, or clicking on ads on Google searches, you are susceptible to this phishing attack**. Always verify you're on the correct site's URL. Most responsible businesses will have an Extended Validation SSL certificate, which shows their company name in green in the navigation bar when you visit the site. Look for it, and if you don't find it, double check the URL you're visiting.\n\nFor instance, if you visit bitskins.com on non-mobile browsers, you will see a green \"BitSkins, Inc. [US]\" in your navigation bar. This tells you you're really at BitSkins.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Protecting your Trades**\n\nAn easy way to avoid this is to ask the sender of the trade to tell you unreplicable information, such as the **Steam Join Date** of the profile. Check to make sure you're trading items to the entity you expected that has the same Steam Join Date. BitSkins, Inc. shows you this to help.\n\nAs always, **use Two-Factor Authentication** or Secure Access on any sites where you *can* login via Steam OpenID.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI've kept this brief but there are alot of nuances here. If you have any questions, post below and I will do my best to answer.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nExample of this ongoing phishing attack: bitskins.us.com. **Do not login, just observe the behavior** by viewing the page's source code when you click Sign in with Steam.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAtif\n\nBitSkins, Inc.\n","thumbnail":"self","date":"2018-02-23","time":"02:52:48","is_self":"true","score":"156","author":"kindoge","subreddit":"GlobalOffensiveTrade","subreddit_id":"t5_2y6r4","rn":"1"}

Why do people on this sub feel the need to down vote others so easily? I understand if the comment is offensive, rude, or even if the person is low balling. That\u2019s obviously what down voting should be for. But it shouldn\u2019t be for you to just press when you see someone make a minor mistake. Why not simply tell them where they have messed up instead of down voting them? Why are people here so unforgiving? What is gained out of it? I honestly want to know what your thoughts are\n\nEdit: If you\u2019re going to down vote me like many have already, at least give an explanation lol\n\nEdit 2: I just wanted to say thank you. I know it seems like nothing much, but to me it means a lot to know someone took the time to read this. So thank you to anyone who has taken the time out of their day to read this. Regardless of the down votes and everything else, I still appreciate every person who has read this.
